# Splitter

**Splitter** is a quick and dirty solution to split (possibly large) files by regexp into parts, 
and output them into a new subdirectory of the given outdir option (defaults to the current directory).

Calls shell commands grep and cut to get the byte boundaries of the matches.
Does nothing if the regexp doesn't match anything in the input file.

## Usage

    ./splitter.py '^Foo' -i example.yml -o .

## Help

    ./splitter.py -h
